And here we are using this language to make our web pages more effective as well as interactive for users to understand. And to make our web pages dynamic we are using JavaScript and XML.

They can be used to define way of writing or style, size of various table, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a static page's HTML. The main work of CSS is to separate content of a web document (written in any markup language) that is written using Cascading Style Sheets. There are lots of benefits that one can extract through this like improved content accessibility, better flexibility and moreover, and hence gives a level of control over various presentation characteristics of the document. It also helps in reducing the problems and helps in saving access time. It gives the option of selecting various style schemes and rules according to the necessity.
